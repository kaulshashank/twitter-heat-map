# Twitter tweets heat map

To run the application, navigate to `client` and `server` directories in seperate terminals and run the following command to install the dependencies.
```
> npm install
```
Then in client folder run:
```
> npm start
```
In server folder run:
```
> node app.js
```
## Note

The application uses only those tweets that have geolocation enabled, so recommended hashtags include #traffic, #beach, and similar.
